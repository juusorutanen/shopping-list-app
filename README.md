# shopping-list-app

A full stack application utilizing RESTful API, where user can login with email and create a shopping list. Userdata, sessions, and shopping lists are stored in Mongodb. 
Made with React, Mongodb, Node.js, Express, Mongoose &amp; CSS/Bootstrap. Additionally, bcrypt for used for password hashing and crypto for middleware function.

The application uses fundamental features of React such as hooks, context, and props. A separate state manager component was created to allow components to access and dispatch actions to modify state.
The app was originally styled with only using Bootstrap, but I later decided to modify its appearance with CSS.
